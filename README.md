# SDMProject
In this project, we examine potential factors that lead to income bias for the 50K income bracket using various classification methods to evaluate the traditional US Adult Income Dataset (income 50K per year). We train the dataset and produce robust models over cross validation. We also observe estimation stability using bootstrap.
